# tensorfield-torch
This is a PyTorch implementation of the idea presented in the paper
[***"Tensor Field Networks: Rotation- and translation-equivariant neural networks for 3D point clouds"***](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08219.pdf)

The original implementation based on Tensorflow can be found [here](
